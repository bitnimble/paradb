## PC instructions

1. Download a map file from one of the map pages. This should save as a zip file, e.g. `Hotel California.zip`
2. Move the zip file from the downloaded location to `Documents/Paradiddle/Songs/Hotel California.zip`.
3. Unzip the zip file, creating a folder of the same name. For example, if the song was "Hotel California", the folder structure should end up looking as follows:
    ```
    Documents/
    ├─ Paradiddle/
    │  ├─ Songs/
    │  │  ├─ Hotel California/
    │  │  │  ├─ Hotel California_Easy.rlrr
    │  │  │  ├─ Hotel California_Medium.rlrr
    │  │  │  ├─ Hotel California_Hard.rlrr
    │  │  │  ├─ Hotel California_Expert.rlrr
    │  │  │  ├─ drums_1.ogg
    │  │  │  ├─ ...
    ```
    Note: it is important that the folder name matches the song / rlrr filename -- otherwise, the song will appear in the game but won't be playable.
4. Delete the zip file, open up the game and enjoy your new map!

## Quest instructions

1. Mount your Quest's file system into the device that you're using to download the maps.
2. Download a map file from one of the map pages. This should save as a zip file, e.g. `Hotel California.zip`
3. Move the zip file from the downloaded location to `Quest/Internal Shared Storage/Paradiddle/Songs/Hotel California.zip`. You may need to create the "Paradiddle" and "Songs" directories if they don't exist yet.
4. Unzip the zip file, creating a folder of the same name. For example, if the song was "Hotel California", the folder structure should end up looking as follows:
    ```
    Quest/
    ├─ Internal Shared Storage/
    │  ├─ Paradiddle/
    │  │  ├─ Songs/
    │  │  │  ├─ Hotel California/
    │  │  │  │  ├─ Hotel California_Easy.rlrr
    │  │  │  │  ├─ Hotel California_Medium.rlrr
    │  │  │  │  ├─ Hotel California_Hard.rlrr
    │  │  │  │  ├─ Hotel California_Expert.rlrr
    │  │  │  │  ├─ drums_1.ogg
    │  │  │  │  ├─ ...
    ```
    Note: it is important that the folder name matches the song / rlrr filename -- otherwise, the song will appear in the game but won't be playable.
5. Delete the zip file, open up the game and enjoy your new map!
